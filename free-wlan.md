<h1 style="font-size: 4rem; line-height: 1.2">Dear Guest,</h1>

I'm offering my internet connection for free because I am of the opinion that Internet should be a universal human right.  
Use it as you like but please stick to the house rules â€“ do not do illegal or dirty stuff.

Please support free and uncensored internet (for example by donating to <a href="https://eff.org">eff.org</a>).

You're also welcome to bear parts of the costs for this service via [PayPal donation](https://paypal.me/xiphe) or by [hiring me](http://xiphe.net).

If you do not have money to spare but still want to support me, I also 
love [likes on my FaceBook Page](https://www.facebook.com/hannesdiem) or 
[subscribes to my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCONYaNqDnjsfxIjkWgd_f8w)


You could also buy this guy a beer or a yerba mate when you meet him:

Lastly, please be excellent to other creatures.  
Yours faithfully, Hannes
