I use this stuff on a daily basis. As a result I provide the most value when a challenge is somewhere near to this cosmos.

**JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Git, React, Redux (+ common react libraries), npm (+ yarn, scripts, tooling), Jest (+ Jasmine, Mocha, Sinon.JS), GitHub (+ integrations/apps), Serverles (+ AWS, GCP, Firebase), webpack (+ Parcel, Rollup), Babel, HTML, CSS (+ less, sass, css-in-js), Cypress (or TestCafe Nightwatch.js), Express, Vue.js â€¦**

### ðŸ¥ˆ Soft and Secondary Skills

I feel most productive in an environment where these techniques are/ can be applied. I also feel comfortable introducing them to teams.

**Kanban, Retrospectives, Git/PR based workflows, Continuous Integration/Delivery, Semantic Versioning, ESLint, npm (packaging, automation), pair programming, Pomodoro, test driven development, â€¦**

<br />

### ðŸ¤“ Fields of Interest

I'm currently interested in these topics. If you have projects in these
domains I will most likely invest additional personal free time in learning 
things and can apply that to your product.

**Making the world a better place, Visual Regression / Deep UI testing, lambda@edge for server side rendering, â€¦**

<br />
