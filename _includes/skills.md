### ðŸ’¥ Primary Skills

I use this stuff on a daily basis. As a result I provide the most value when a challenge is somewhere near to this cosmos.

**JavaScript (ES5-latest), Git, Node.js, React, Redux, npm (scripts and API), Jest (or Jasmine, Mocha, Sinon.JS), GitHub (+integrations), Serverless, webpack, Babel, HTML, CSS (or less, sass), TestCafe (or Nightwatch.js, Cypress), Express, Vue.js â€¦**

<br />

### ðŸ¥ˆ Soft and Secondary Skills

I feel most productive in an environment where these techniques are/ can be applied. I also feel comfortable introducing them to teams.

**Kanban, Retrospectives, GitHub based workflows, Continuous Integration/Delivery, Semantic Versioning, ESLint, npm (packaging, automation), pair programming, Pomodoro, test driven development, â€¦**

<br />

### ðŸ¤“ Fields of Interest

I have little to no practical experience with these things but would love to work with people who have or contribute to projects that utilize them.

I will give a discount when booked on projects where I can gain experience in these topics and will probably invest personal free time in learning things related to your product.

**(practical applied) domain driven design, Artificial Neural Networks, AWS or GCP from a Dev-Ops perspective, â€¦**

<br />

I might be a bit rusty in using these - because I favour other methods by now - but I stell feel comfortable in working with those technologies and techniques.
