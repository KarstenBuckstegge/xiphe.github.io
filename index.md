<h1 style="font-size: 3rem; line-height: 1.2">Hi! My name is Hannes. I’m a Freelance JavaScript architect.</h1>

Modern web applications tend to be huge and complex systems and more and more logic is being done in the clients or in nodejs. This is inflicting all sorts of new challenges to developers which I strive to find the best solutions for.

I’m working in, observing and shaping companies that build big web apps for a good 5 Years. I’m deeply interested in maintainability, scalability, automation, work culture and team building. Especially in frontend development teams. 

As a quick learner, I am able to pick up common best practices as well as the latest cutting edge concepts to tailor solutions for the specific problems we are facing. Whether is purely technical in code or more on a team/company meta-level.
