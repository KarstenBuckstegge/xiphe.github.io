<h2 class="home-section" id="expertise">My Expertise</h2>

<div class="grid">
  <div class="grid-entry">
    <h3>📱 Frontend</h3>
    <p>No matter which tech stack <em>(I prefer react-ish, though)</em>, I focus on solid architecture and clear separation of concerns. I deploy fast and refactor often in order to deliver high value products.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="grid-entry">
    <h3>🤖 Automation</h3>
    <p>Why should we spend time doing stuff a machine could do? I setup continuous integration, automated builds, semantic release, etc. as early as possible to maximize saved time by these tools.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="grid-entry">
    <h3>🎨 Design Systems</h3>
    <p>I pioneered the UI Library of <a href="https://www.jimdo.com/">Jimdo</a> in 2015. Since then I successfully helped three major companies <em>(and lots of smaller projects)</em> to shift their workflows from waterfall to collaborative. Overall causing huge improvements in accessability, performance and consistency. 
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="grid-entry">
    <h3>🚀 Serverless/Cloud</h3>
    <p>I’m an early adopter of serverless, deeply interested in the methodology and honestly cant stand the idea of a running server doing nothing.
    My service designs fit the constrains of surrounding providers like AWS and Firebase
    and are micro and maintainable.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="grid-entry">
    <h3>👮‍♀️ QA/Testing</h3>
    <p>With a background in graphic design, I care for visuals and usability. 
     I‘m used to test driven development and also love to <a href="https://xiphe.net/lmttfy/">write tests for existing code</a>. No matter if unit or end-to-end, I find the best approach to provide stability.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="grid-entry">
    <h3>💭 Mindset</h3>
    <p>You need to tick in a certain way to build cutting edge products. There’s more than just hard requirements and solid code. I care for the bigger picture, for the team and for clear communication. I’m an agile mind and I try to help on all levels.</p>

<div class="grid">
  <div class="grid-entry">
    <h3>🧐 Review session</h3>
    <p>I can be your second mind or other pair of eyes on a particular problem. No matter if it’s just an hour of talking or an extensive review of your application.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="grid-entry">
    <h3>👯‍♂️ Coaching</h3>
    <p>You want to learn <a href="/#skills">s.th. that I know</a>? I will give my very best to enable you in intense pairing sessions, no matter your skill level.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="grid-entry">
    <h3>👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Consulting</h3>
    <p>I dive deep into a team and try to help and improve in all aspects I see fit. As a team member I work on daily tasks, will try to identify bottlenecks and spread my knowledge.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="grid-entry">
    <h3>👨‍🏫 Workshops/Talks</h3>
    <p>I love to give talks about what I have learned or am interested in. I also design individual workshops for your team to hands-on teach them what I know and how I work.</p>

<h2 class="home-section" id="current-location">Current Location: 🇪🇸 Tarifa</h2>

As a digital nomad, I normally work remote and have received consistently positive feedback for my reachability, documentation and communication. But I also like to work on site when it is suitable.
