<div class="grid">
  <div class="grid-entry">
    <h3>📱 Frontend</h3>
    <p>No matter which tech stack <em>(I prefer react-ish, though)</em>, I focus on solid architecture and clear separation of concerns. I deploy fast and refactor often in order to deliver high value products.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="grid-entry">
    <h3>🤖 Automation</h3>
    <p>Why should we spend time doing stuff a machine could do? I setup continuous integration, automated builds, semantic release, etc. as early as possible to maximize saved time by these tools.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="grid-entry">
    <h3>👮‍♀️ QA</h3>
    <p>With a background in graphic design, I care for visuals and usability. I‘m used to test driven development and have a deep knowledge on browser automation.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="grid-entry">
    <h3>🚀 Serverless</h3>
    <p>I’m an early adopter of the serverless methodology. All of my own products and tools (like <a href="https://patternson.io">patternson.io</a>) run on infrastructure that only costs money when something is actively used.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="grid-entry">
    <h3>💭 Mindset</h3>
    <p>You need to tick in a certain way to build cutting edge products. There’s more than just hard requirements and solid code. I care for the bigger picture, for the team and for clear communication. I’m an agile mind and I try to help on all levels.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="grid-entry">
    <h3>🏫 Learning</h3>
    <p>The web industry is fast! One needs to learn quick and adapt fast in order to stay upfront. I help my clients to wrap their head around new concepts. I'm an excellent pairing partner and used to write the right amount of documentation for APIs.</p>

  <div class="grid-entry">
    <h3>🧐 Review session</h3>

  </div>

    <h3>👯‍♂️ Coaching</h3>

  <div class="grid-entry">
    <h3>👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Consulting</h3>
    <p>I dive deep into a team and try to help and improve in all aspects I see fit. As a team member I work on daily tasks, will try to identify bottlenecks and spread my knowledge.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="grid-entry">
    <h3>🌴 Bootcamp</h3>
