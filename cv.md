Work I'm especially proud of:

<br />
**2017 Q1-2**
### Creation of an interface library and development environment for a multi-million user Social-Network 

My focus was architectural component design, lean tooling and workflows, cross team communication and overall code quality.  
The tool is now providing the technical fundament for more than four product teams and probably
will be used by all front-end teams in the near future.

<br />
**2015 - 2016** 
### Jimdo UI Library

The Jimdo UI Library is a design and development environment and process that successfully reduced
development time, unified the appearance of the product and played a significant role in a comprehensive redesign mid 2016.
I was the lead developer for technical concepts and implementation after I envisioned and started this project along with [Fabian Fabian](https://twitter.com/filtercake) and my brother [Lasse Diercks](https://twitter.com/lassediercks).  
A part of the project is visible as the [Jimdo UI Hub](http://jimdo.github.io/ui-library/).

<br />
**2015 - 2016**
### Modernising tooling/CD all internal front-end dependencies of Jimdo

I moved 20+ front-end modules (OSS and private) from bower, grunt/gulp, manual versioning, testing,
releasing to a state of the art front-end tooling stack using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), [travis ci](https://travis-ci.org/), ...

<br />
**2014 - 2015** 
### Jimdo Template Selection and and Customisation

Along with one of the best teams I've ever worked with, I've created the current templating and customisation system of Jimdo. Focussing on front-end architecture, front-end tooling, user experience, integration with our legacy stack and data-driven development of related systems.

<br />
**2014 - present** 
### Converting people to use and utilize commit message formats 

I'm an ambassador of writing meaningfull commit messages and maintaining a usefull git commit log.
It not only eases up the work of my fellow developers and future me, it also enables a tremendous amount
of automatisation and tools.

I've also held a talk about that on JS-Unconf 2016 – [here are the slides for "stop writing commitMESSages"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EXXRzbT17rbD7CFXugPZgvgMhsoVE1XXSA7UxBl3iXw/edit?usp=sharing
).
